The software should be accessible via a command-line application named something like "conversion" or "convert".

The software should be able to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius, in either direction.

This conversion should be possible entirely through parameters passed in at the command line.

The command-line syntax should be something like this:
convert [unit of temperature measurement] [temperature numeric value]

Examples:
To convert from 32 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius -
convert f 32
(should produce 0)

To convert from 100 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit -
convert c 100
(should produce 212)
